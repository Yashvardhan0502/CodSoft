Python projects 
This project is a basic to-do list application built using the Tkinter library in Python. It allows users to add and delete tasks in a graphical user interface. The tasks are displayed in a Listbox, and new tasks are stored in a file named `data.txt`. The application's interface includes labels, buttons for adding and deleting tasks, and a text input for entering new tasks.
